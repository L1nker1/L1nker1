HiðŸ‘‹! I'm Diego Lucas Roldan, from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Welcome to my github profile, take your time.

## About me
I'm a fullstack web developer, 
       I like to work with other people, also I have great adaptability and predisposition.
During this year I studied and finished the full stack web developer bootcamp at Henry with +700 hours of practice/theory doing individual and group projects where I learned about  back-end and front-end bases, with extensive use of javascript with their libraries and frameworks.
Also iÂ´m currently on my second year at the "Universidad Nacional De Avellaneda" (UNDAV).

- I'm currently working on finishing my e-commerce grupal project, and the CCS of a proyect about Foods I worked on at SoyHenry.
- I'm interested to learn more about front-end development.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Projects.
- Ask me about JavaScript, React, React Native, Redux, HTML, CSS, Node JS, Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Bootstrap

### Soft skills
-I consider myself as someone who is really Respectfull to others, as I like them to be as respectfull to myself. This helps other people to feel comfortable when talking about a project, work, or ideas in general.
-My time at Lawyer carrer, gave me some abilities, like debating, comunicating, about ideas and proposals.
-Some fluent and clear way of speaking with people.
-More than one time, I had to take leadership on Proyects, talk about proposals and help other team mates what we were being asked to do at the proyect.
